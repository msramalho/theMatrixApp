What is a Bank Account Security Matrix Card?
Essentially, a table of digits that function as a second layer of authentication (2FA Two-Factor Authentication). On each important transaction your bank will ask you for 3 random digits of this Table to ensure a more secure transaction. Most people save their matrices in paper format, with this app that is a thing of the past!
